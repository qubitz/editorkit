Code of Conduct
===============

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.

The Code of Conduct specifies a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles can talk about EditorKit effectively, productively, and respectfully, even in face of disagreements. The Code of Conduct also provides a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.

Our Values
----------

These are the values EditorKit developers should aspire to:

  * Be friendly and welcoming
  * Be patient
    * Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)
  * Be thoughtful
    * Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
    * Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
  * Be respectful
    * Respect differences of opinion. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
    * Jokes are greatly appreciated in good taste.
  * Avoid destructive behavior
    * Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
    * Unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs; offer (or at least solicit) suggestions as to how things may be improved.
    * Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments).

The following actions are explicitly forbidden:

  * Insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks.
  * Discrimination based on age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.
  * Bullying or systematic harassment.
  * Unwelcome sexual advances.
  * Incitement to any of these.

Where does the Code of Conduct apply?
-------------------------------------

If you participate in or contribute to the EditorKit ecosystem in any way, you are encouraged to follow the Code of Conduct while doing so.

Explicit enforcement of the Code of Conduct applies to the EditorKit GitHub project and code reviews therein.

Project maintainers may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

Due to the size of this project, all instances of abuse, harassment, or otherwise unacceptable behavior as noticed by maintainers will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. 

**The goal of the Code of Conduct is to resolve conflicts in the most harmonious way possible**. We hope that in most cases issues may be resolved through polite discussion and mutual agreement. Bannings and other forceful measures are to be employed only as a last resort. **Do not** post about the issue publicly or try to rally sentiment against a particular individual or group.
